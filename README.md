## curve-fitting

Plot a number of exponential equations on a 2D plane. Let them fade out over time.

### Running

Launch a Clojure REPL:

    make dev

Start the server by evaluating `(go)` at the REPL.

Once you have made changes you can reload the visualization with `(reset)`.

You can completely shutdown the visualization by evaluating `(halt)`.
